    <a name="version-1.9.5.2" />

        <li>A couple more compatibility fixes for OS X Lion (10.7) which were missed in the last hotfix</li>
    </ul>

    <a name="version-1.9.5.1" />
    <h2>SourceTree 1.9.5.1 - hotfix</h2>
    <b>Bugfixes</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Fix compatibility issues with OS X Lion (10.7)</li>
        <li>Fix problem with authentication prompt when using HTTPS URL on private git repos</li>
        <li>Fix missing right-click menu on files within a commit when viewing in tree view</li>
    </ul>

    <a name="version-1.9.5" />
    <h2>SourceTree 1.9.5 - optimisation &amp; bugfix release</h2>
    <b>Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Support git 2.0's new default push.branch mode of 'simple' rather than 'matching'. SourceTree will detect what version of git you're running and will reflect
        the default for that version if you haven't explicitly chosen a mode.</li>
        <li>SourceTree will no longer auto-refresh when changes are detected inside ignored directories. For this to work the directory itself needs to be ignored rather than the file that changed, since the Mac FSEvents notifier only includes directory information. Both the global ignore and the root repository-specific .gitignore/.hgignore are used to filter auto-refresh events.</li>
        <li>Memory optimisations; SourceTree should now use less memory and release it faster as windows are closed.</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Bugfixes</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Fix random crash in NSFileHandle which would occur with variable frequency depending on the user</li>
        <li>Fix garbled characters in log when a commit has been made with Cyrillic 866 encoded characters (probably on Windows) in the message or author, which previously broke decoding hard and caused a backup non-UTF decoder to be used which garbled all other commit lines in that batch. Now we manually sanitise that broken commit so other rows can be decoded as valid UTF</li>
        <li>Also deal with another case of bad encoding which could cause single commits to be omitted from the log</li>
        <li>Make sure log refreshes immediately after creating a tag</li>
        <li>In the rare case that a TTY could not be created, avoid hanging &amp; report properly in the log. Should never occur really but there is a possible resource starvation case.</li>
        <li>Fix for git credential helper not saving the password when core git credential helper isn't present. Reworked in such a way it doesn't cause constant user prompts to access keychain like previous fix did.</li>
        <li>Fix incorrect date format in command output history pane (SRCTREE-2501)</li>
        <li>Fix inability to close Preferences window if both the Full Name and Email Address fields are left blank (SRCTREE-2491)</li>
        <li>When defaulting the push destination in git with push.branch set to 'matching', prefer origin over other remotes (SRCTREE-2489)</li>
        <li>Fix sorting problems in log view, including sort by filename and tree view sorting</li>
        <li>Prevent very long branch names from overlapping the buttons in the Commit panel (SRCTREE-2496)</li>
        <li>Do not reset Hide Remote Branches option when simply selecting a local branch. (SRCTREE-2469)</li>
        <li>Don't reset the branch filter when the branch you clicked on is the branch already being filtered by.</li>
        <li>Fix using 'Current Branch' option in log view on a detached HEAD causing a git error (SRCTREE-2475)</li>
        <li>Fix the display of HEAD in the sidebar in more recent versions of git when on a detached HEAD</li>
        <li>When double-clicking to switch branch, don't reset the filter away from 'Current Branch' (SRCTREE-2461)</li>
        <li>Clicking 'Details' button on a failed clone URL detection now provides output in a scrollable sheet, not a window which might be too big (SRCTREE-2452)</li>
        <li>Fix split view errors in log when restoring a small window, hopefully fixes intermittent splitview size issues</li>
        <li>Fix stuck refresh in file list</li>
        <li>Double-clicking folders in the tree view now opens in Finder, as in 1.8</li>
        <li>Support double-clicking files &amp; folders in the tree view when viewing a commit</li>
        <li>Sanitise git remote names more strictly than just spaces, don't allow other characters like : ^ etc (SRCTREE-2518)</li>
        <li>Disallow creating duplicate remote names</li>
        <li>Fix some GitHub API error messages not being displayed in full in the hosted repositories login error dialog</li>
        <li>Better preservation of tree view expanded state when staging/unstaging (SRCTREE-2485)</li>
    </ul>

    <a name="version-1.9.4" />
    <h2>SourceTree 1.9.4 - minor release</h2>
    <b>Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
        <li>The commit details file list now supports all 3 view modes (single col, multi-col and tree) just like the file status view</li>
        <li>When the current selected file disappears from the file status list (staging/unstaging/deleting), select the file after or before it on next refresh, rather than reset to the first item (SRCTREE-2427). This is more intuitive when staging one file after another in longer lists.</li>
        <li>The diff view scrolling behaviour is now faster &amp; smoother</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Bugfixes</b>
    <ul>

        <li>Speed up the re-refresh when switching view modes if another refresh was in flight when you changed it</li>
        <li>Fix view option tip pop-up being able to be vertically compressed so not displaying full message on some setups</li>
        <li>Fix error reporting when a failure occurs during staging/unstaging (SRCTREE-2442)</li>
        <li>Fix disabling the analytics in the welcome wizard not correctly disabling the option in Preferences (SRCTREE-2447)</li>
    </ul>

    <a name="version-1.9.3.1" />

    <b>Bugfixes</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Fix crash when dragging item from tree view with fluid staging mode or no staging mode enabled (SRCTREE-2414)</li>
        <li>Make 'Sort by path' more intuitive; search by folder, then filename within rather than by full path
        This means that items in higher folder levels get listed together, instead of with subfolders potentially in between</li>
        <li>Fix HTTPS authentication in git constantly prompting for access to the keychain even if Always Allow is clicked (SRCTREE-2422)</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Enhancements</b>

    <a name="version-1.9.3" />
    <h2>SourceTree 1.9.3 - UX feedback update &amp; bugfix release</h2>
    <b>Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
        <li><b>New file view options: </b>Based on user feedback we've added additional options to customise the file status view, which are available from a new button in the scope bar:
            <ul>
                <li>Flat list (single column) - display files as a flat list with the full path (previously the only option in 1.9)</li>
                <li>Flat list (multiple columns) - still a flat list but split the file name and path into separate columns (1.8 flat style)</li>
                <li>Tree view - display the files &amp; containing folders as a tree</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>New staging options:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>No staging - don't use staging</li>
                <li>Fluid staging - files are in one list with headers for staged / unstaged, previously the only option in 1.9</li>
                <li>Split view staging - staged/unstaged files are in 2 separate lists with a vertical split, and you can drag/drop between them</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Commit selected</b> is back: if you're not using staging this just flips the right checkboxes for you, but if you're using git staging then you'll be temporarily switched to 'No staging' mode so you can commit checked files separate to your index, and then returned to your staging view afterwards.</li>
        <li>Allow blank email to be set in repo preferences if user requires it (SRCTREE-1904)</li>

        <li>Fix tab navigation when editing remotes (SRCTREE-2344)</li>
        <li>Ignore hg-checklink- files in auto-refresh</li>
        <li>Fix not being able to commit if global preference is set to push but repo has no remotes (SRCTREE-2335)</li>
        <li>Don't display "(null)/master" as push target in commit popup when no remotes exist. </li>
        <li>When switching from file status to log view uncommitted &amp; back, make sure filter is synced as well as content so mismatch can't happen (SRCTREE-2351)</li>
        <li>Make sure draft commit message is saved if application / window is closed while commit panel is still expanded (SRCTREE-2356)</li>
        <li>Make sure uncommitted line is included in log when only change is a missing file (SRCTREE-2381)</li>

            You used to be able to do Shift-Cmd-R but this was supposed to be the toolbar revert, i.e. a dialog, when this was fixed you lost the ability to do a keyboard-only revert of the current selection, so add a new shortcut</li>

        <li><b>Reverse granular changes from previous commits</b> - there are now 'Reverse' buttons in 
            the diff pane of the log view allowing you to reverse changes from previous commits at a file, 
            hunk and even line level. This gives you more flexibility over backing out an entire commit.</li>

        <li><b>Mercurial:</b>

                <li>Embedded Mercurial updated to 2.2.2</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>When using a fixed-width font in the commit window, a line length guide is now available (72
            characters by default)</li>
        <li>In fullscreen mode it's now easier to identify repositories due to the title being displayed in the bottom right.</li>
        <li>Support creating new repositories under team / organisation accounts in Bitbucket</li>

        <li>Retina friendly main application icon. Icons within the app will be updated for Retina displays soon.</li>
        <li>Updated to new official git icon. Used a monochrome version in most cases though because early testers reported that the
	        orange version looked too much like an error/warning icon when it appeared in the UI.</li>

            on Mac OS 10.6 at least once in order to get the update which then fixes future auto-updates)</li>
        <li>Fixed log view not refreshing on pull/strip/reverse operations when auto-refresh (based on file events) is disabled</li>

    <h2>SourceTree 1.4 - Major Release</h2>
    <b>New features:</b>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Bookmarks window overhaul!</b>
            <ul><li>New improved visual style; more compact and easier on the eyes</li>
                <li>Live searching</li>
                <li>Sorting by name / type at any level</li>
                <li>New menus let you get to lots of functions without opening the full repo window, including Custom Actions you've defined</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Atlassian Stash support</b> The Hosted Projects view now supports Atlassian's new DVCS behind the firewall enterprise solution: Stash.</li>
        <li><b>Clone from web links</b> Bitbucket and Atlassian Stash now expose 'Clone in SourceTree' links which can 
            be used to automatically launch or switch to SourceTree and begin the clone operation. You can also
            use the GitHub 'Clone in Mac' links to drive SourceTree if you enable it in Preferences.</li>
        <li><b>New setup wizard</b> leads new users through their initial configuration, setting up Bitbucket and GitHub accounts, searching for local repositories etc.</li>
        <li><b>Mercurial Bookmarks</b> are now fully supported (akin to local branches in Git). Previously these were displayed in the log but you could not manipulate them. Mercurial Bookmarks are now displayed in the sidebar and you can define them inside SourceTree.</li>
        <li><b>The Log View uncommitted line mode</b> has been significantly enhanced, meaning all the features available in the File Status view are now also available when selecting the uncommitted line in the Log View (previously you could only perform a subset of the actions).</li>
        <li><b>Commit message drafting</b> - you can now draft commit messages well before you actually commit by clicking the icon at the bottom-left of the repository window or pressing Cmd-Shift-D.</li>
        <li><b>Custom URL protocol support</b> - SourceTree will now respond to URLs of the form "sourcetree://cloneRepo/&lt;CLONE_URL&gt;" so websites can expose clickable links to clone in SourceTree. Also SourceTree will optionally handle github-mac:// URLs if GitHub for Mac isn't installed (or if the user sets Preferences to prefer SourceTree).</li>
        <li><b>Archive support</b> exports a copy of your source code to a compressed archive, minus the repository metadata.</li>
        <li><b>Miscellaneous improvements:</b></li>
            <ul><li>Improved support for handling multiple heads per branch in Mercurial</li>
                <li>Repository-level custom actions are now available on file/log context menus too and not just on the main menu bar</li>
                <li>Support for ignoring multiple individual files/folders at once rather than only via a pattern</li>
                <li>Commit text views now remember and share changes to their spell checking / correction settings</li>
                <li>Add the option not to display the 'Add Bookmarks' window when opening unbookmarked repositories</li>
                <li>Prune the log view more in Git when 'Current Branch' is selected when 'Show Remote Branches' is still enabled</li>
                <li>Dragging plain (non-repository) folders into SourceTree now defaults to creating a new repository in that folder</li>
                <li>Clickable parent links in commit details pane in log &amp; search views</li>
            </ul></li>

    <h2>SourceTree 1.4.1 - Changes since 1.4.0/1.4.0b2</h2>

        <li>Support git commit '--signoff' and '--author' options</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Bugfixes:</b>
    <ul><li>Fix diff &amp; staging when user enables diff.mnemonicprefix option in their global config</li>
        <li>Commit parent links should cope with git octopus merges</li>
        <li>Fix git commit sheet displaying selected files mode instead of staging mode if launched from the log view when a previous commit is selected</li>
        <li>When installing command line tools, deal gracefully with missing /usr/local/bin </li>
    </ul>


    <a name="version-1.3.3"/> 
    <h2>SourceTree 1.3.3 - Patch Release</h2>
    <b>Bugfixes:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Prevent 'git stash show' diff view being broken by user options like diff.external and colours</li>
        <li>Allow any file to be brought in as a patch file, since the Lion open dialog doesn't allow file type filters to be overridden easily</li>
        <li>Suppress refreshes while applying patch files to avoid thrashing on large patches.</li>
        <li>Optimised processing of command output, particularly large outputs like large stashes / diffs</li>
        <li>Optimisation of memory consumption when dealing with edge cases like viewing very large stashes</li>
        <li>Fix SourceTree reporting SSL errors for self-signed certs in Mercurial when command line just displayed warnings</li>
        <li>Change confirmation message on Git delete remote branch to make it clearer that the change affects the remote</li>
        <li>Git push dialog now respects manually configured push settings, for example those used by Gerrit, while still not needing to check remote. Wildcard matching is also supported.</li>
        <li>Prevent the rare case of the repository refresh causing the sidebar selection to override the log view selection, jumping the view elsewhere.</li>
        <li>Improved handling of inconsistently formatted responses from some hosting APIs.</li>
        <li>Sync 'Select All' checkbox with manual selection changes in Git push dialog</li>
        <li>Don't fail when unshelving changes in hg if the same shelf had been unshelved previously without deleting and then reverted</li>
        <li>Stop hgattic overriding the commit behaviour when you apply a shelved change but don't delete it, causing it to try in vain to open Vim</li>

    </ul>
    
    <a name="version-1.3.2"/> 
    <h2>SourceTree 1.3.2 - Patch Release</h2>
    <b>Enhancements:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Git pull &amp; push sheets no longer query for remote branches unless prompted to do so, or you use a custom remote path. This speeds up the dialogs considerably; you can click the 'Refresh' button to see any branches you haven't fetched yet on the pull sheet.</li>
        <li>You can now stop a branch from tracking any remote branch from the sidebar, rather than just being able to set it to another branch. </li>
        <li>Unchecking the 'Track?' option in the git push dialog now untracks the branch;
            previously this only stopped the tracking relationship being set up. The 'Track?' checkbox is now mixed-state, where 'on' means set the tracking relationship, '-' means no change, and 'off' disables tracking on that branch.</li>
        <li>Allow confirmation dialog on branch switch to be disabled in preferences when working copy is clean</li>
        <li>Add extra keyboard shortcuts for log/blame selected</li>
        <li>Diff colours are now configurable in Preferences for accessibility.</li>
        <li>Add an explicit manual refresh button to hosted projects view (View > Refresh / Cmd-R also works)</li>

    </ul>
    <b>Bugfixes:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Fix gravatar display for emails with +/- in them</li>
        <li>Disallow email addresses as user name for Bitbucket/GitHub, require real user name to avoid invalid clone URLs</li>
        <li>Fix JIRA links consuming superstring references to same-named Crucible project</li>
        <li>Display uninitialised submodules in git. Allow uninitialised git submodules to be automatically initialised when you double-click on their sidebar entry</li>
        <li>When submodules require login and are on a different host, make sure any request for user details is clear about which one is being asked for.</li>
        <li>Automatically synchronise git submodules on pull/checkout, to pick up new submodules and changes in tracked commit without user intervention</li>
        <li>Add '--recursive' option to git submodules update in case you like submodules in your submodules</li>
        <li>Fix items in the sidebar sometimes being cut off so the annotations were not visible.</li>
        <li>Fix problem with using '#' characters in regex commit replacements</li>
        <li>When using 'Discard' or 'Reset' specifically on a working copy change in git, *only* undo the changes in the working copy (git checkout), keep the index. This was potentially confusing.</li>
        <li>Fix conflict between hgsubversion &amp; subrepositories with hg 2.0.1+ which could cause cloning with subrepos to fail.</li>
        <li>Remove defaulting of destination path in clone dialog on App Store version, Apple object to it and say we must remove it. It remains in the direct version.</li>
        <li>Extra safety checking to make sure keycode isn't ever nil on custom actions.</li>
        <li>Always use git config setting core.quotepath to deal with filenames which include utf8.        Previously this had to be set in the gitconfig by the user</li>
        <li>Add an author map file option to cloning from Subversion.</li>
        <li>Fix crash when using 'Current Branch' filter in hg on a newly created uncommitted branch. Also fix content display in this case since hg won't filter on that branch until it's committed.</li>
        <li>Fix incorrect git pull default branch selection when config manually changed to branch.master.rebase=true</li>
        <li>Suppress error messages from git log before the first commit on an empty repo</li>
        <li>Allow 'unstage' to work on added files in git before the first commit has been made in a blank repo</li>

                <li>Explicitly set the commit message for any submodules / subrepositories that you commit while committing the parent. No more accidental recursive commits in Mercurial, or accidentally missed submodule commits in Git!</li>

<h3>Enhancements:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Viewing differences between 2 arbitrary commits/revisions is now supported. Simply select more than one entry in the log view
 with Cmd-Click, Shift-Click or Shift-Up/Down and SourceTree will show you the difference between
 the outer range of the rows selected.</li>
<li>Viewing  differences between both sides of a merge is now supported. When viewing a merge commit or the 
working folder when a merge is outstanding, the 'Compare to:' option on the diff pane allows you to 
choose which side of the merge to compare with.</li>
<li>The Resolve Conflicts page has been redesigned and is now more detailed; you can see diffs in-place, and can also 
choose to resolve a file conflict using the unmodified content from each side of the merge; 
this is especially important for binary conflicts.</li>
<li>When deleting repository bookmarks, you now have the option of moving the underlying folder to the trash at the same time.</li>

The font size drop-down has been removed from the diff view and instead you should pick the size you want from Preferences. All 
diff views now change immediately when the font is altered in Preferences so you can see the effect.</li>
<li>Files with a status of 'Missing' can now be removed directly either via 'Remove', or 'Stage' (in git)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugfixes:</h3>

<h2>Changes in version 1.1.5:</h2>
<h3>Enhancements:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The diff context level selected in the diff view is now saved and used by default.</li>

<li>Repository windows which are open when you quit now re-open automatically next time (see Preferences to disable)</li>
<li>Each repository window now remembers its own individual frame (instead of sharing a default frame from your last use of any repository). This means
when windows re-open at startup they will also be exactly where you put them.</li>

<h3>Enhancements:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Split view positions for file status view, log view and search view are now remembered, along with separate split settings for

<li>The repository settings panel now includes an option to disable the auto-refresh behaviour for a given repository. 
If you disable the auto-refresh, you can press Cmd-R to manually refresh views, and there is a Refresh toolbar button available

<a name="version-1.0.4.1"/>
<h2>Changes in version 1.0.4.1:</h2>
<h3>Enhancements:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Embedded Mercurial upgraded to 1.7. This was necessary because Mercurial 1.7 includes a breaking change which means 
repositories created with it cannot be opened with previous versions of Mercurial.</li>
<li>Improved the refresh responsiveness on the Resolve Conflicts and Create Branch actions.</li>

<a name="version-1.0.4"/>
<h2>Changes in version 1.0.4:</h2>
<h3>Enhancements:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Many new optimisations keep performance snappy even on extremely large repositories</li>
<li>Auto-refresh behaviour when app is active is now smarter, eliminating duplicate refreshes and detecting very 
large numbers of file changes over a sustained period and throttling the refresh behaviour to keep CPU use down.</li>
<li>New "All Branches" option in log view - uncheck to limit view to just current branch</li>
<li>New ordering option in Git log view (date order, or ancestors first). The former is now the default since ancestors first (or --topo-order)
can be up to 5x slower than date order on extremely large repositories, so it's now by request only.</li>
<li>'Commit' is now split into 'Commit All' (defaults all modified, or staged if Git with staging enabled) and 'Commit Selected' for current selection.
Keyboard shortcut for the previous 'Commit' is 'Commit All' to preserve previous behaviour.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Bugs fixed:</h3>

<a name="version-1.0.3"/>
<h2>Changes in version 1.0.3:</h2>
<h3>Enhancements:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improvements to log graph rendering:
<ul>
  <li>Use a more 'sloped' style rather than curved right-angles. This looks much better when the graph becomes more complicated.</li>
  <li>Style change allows the graph lines to be packed closer together, saving space.</li>
  <li>Graph cells now report their size properly so double-clicking the column divider auto-sizes it correctly</li>
  <li>Tweak the 'colour uniqueness' check so that graph line / commit colours are more distinct</li>
</ul>
<li>Make diff view context slider update interactively which is more intuitive, but clamp to 3-line increments for performance.</li>
<li>Support external diff button in log history view</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugs fixed:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix the context slider on the log view diff pane</li>

<h3>New features:</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://connectedflow.com/changes/">Changes</a> and <a href="http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com/">Kaleidoscope</a> are now directly 
supported as external diff tools so you don't have to use the 'Other' option. 
Note that they're only available as diff tools, not merge tools since they do not support 3-way merges.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugs fixed:</h3>
<ul>
<li>When there are no entries in the log, make sure that the jump button spinner is told to stop.</li>
<li>Fix the search panel on some locales where the max date supported by Mercurial was different.</li>
<li>Git search will now find commits on all branches, not just the current one</li>

<h2>Changes in version 1.0 RC1:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Non-context menu versions of Commit, Revert and Create Patch now default to the selection IF there is more than one file selected.
If only one file is selected, the default selection is used (since we can't know if this was the intention or not &amp; default is safer)</li>
<li>Add double-click action to file status view - opens file</li>
<li>Git was warning twice about adding/removing files (if warning enabled)</li>
<li>Application now tells trial users about trial period remaining every 3 days</li>
