				<h1>Git Flow / Hg Flow Actions</h1>
			</div>
						
			<p>Once you've <a href="flow_init.html">initialised your repository</a>, you're ready to start using Git Flow / Hg Flow. The actions
			you'll be performing are associated with <b>features</b>, <b>releases</b> and <b>hot fixes</b>, each of which is described in more detail
			below.</p>
			
			<h2>Starting a feature</h2>
			<p>You can commit trivial changes direct to the development branch ('develop') if you like, but any time you start on something non-trivial
			you should explicitly start a new <b>feature</b>. This 'Start Feature' action will be the default action from the toolbar if you don't have 
			anything currently in progress, or you can explicitly choose it from the Repository > Git Flow / Hg Flow menu. This will give you the following
			dialog:</p>
			
			<div>
				<img class="icon" src="../shrd/flow_startfeature.png" alt="Flow - Start Feature" />
			</div>
			
			<p>The first thing to note is the 'Preview' section at the bottom, which is present on all of the action dialogs and shows you what will
			actually happen when you confirm the dialog. In this case, a new feature branch called 'feature/my-new-feature' will be created (I used 
			the default prefix when I initialised this repository). You commit your feature implementation to this branch. If you want, you can push 
			the feature branch to your remote while you work on it (your team will decide on whether that's normal practice or not).</p>
			<p>If at any time you want to switch branches, either to another feature branch (you can have as many as you want on the go) or to somewhere
			else, just use the normal mechanisms in SourceTree to do that, such as double-clicking a log entry or a branch in the sidebar. Git Flow and
			Hg Flow determine your context simply from the branch you currently have checked out, so it's fine to jump around if you like.</p>
			<h2>Finishing a feature</h2>
			<p>Eventually when you're done implementing your feature, use the 'Finish Feature' action (again, this will be the default action from the 
			toolbar button if you're on a feature branch):</p>
			<div>
				<img class="icon" src="../shrd/flow_finishfeature.png" />
			</div>
			<p>Again, the Preview shows you what will happen, which is to merge the feature branch into the main development branch, essentially queueing it
			for inclusion in the next release. In Git, feature branches are deleted by default but you can opt to retain them if you like. In
			Mercurial, branches are closed instead since branch deletion isn't allowed.</p>
			

			<h2>Starting a release</h2>
			<p>You start a release when you want to start preparing a new release, which also probably means you want to have a feature freeze. 
			Using the Start Release option from the menu or from the toolbar action selection window brings up the following dialog:</p>
			<div>
				<img class="icon" src="../shrd/flow_startrelease.png" />
			</div>
			<p>Once again the Preview shows you what will happen, which is to create a new release branch. Most of the time, you want to start the release 
			from the latest development branch, but
			you can also choose to base it on another commit if you wish. This essentially freezes the release so it's not affected by subsequent development,
			but you can also perform preparatory tasks on this branch like updating the version number in source files, updating changelogs, or other tweaks
			that need to be committed for the release process. Once these tweaks are done, you can finish the release as described below.</p>
			
			<h2>Finishing a release</h2>
			<p>Once all the adjustments required for the release are done and committed, you can finish the release process; as usual if you're on the release
				branch already then this is the default action from the toolbar button. The dialog is as follows:
			</p>
			<div>
				<img class="icon" alt="Flow - Finish Release" src="../shrd/flow_finishrelease.png" />
			</div>
			<p>The preview illustrates that the release branch will be merged into the production branch ('master' or 'default' normally) to indicate an update
			to the deployed version. A tag will also be created here for the release. The release branch changes will also be merged 
			back into the development branch to make sure that's kept up to date. You can choose some optional behaviour as shown in the dialog which should
			be self-explanatory - note that Hg Flow disables a number of the options in this dialog because it does not support them, but the actions are the
			same.</p>


			<h2>Starting a hotfix</h2>
			<p>What if you need to just fix a bug on the latest release? You don't want to create a new release, because that will pick up the 
			recent changes from the development branch. So instead, you start a hot fix:</p>
			<div>
				<img class="icon" src="../shrd/flow_starthotfix.png" />
			</div>
			<p>Hot fixes always start from the latest production code (from the 'master' or 'default' branch), as the preview shows. Other than that, they're
			basically the same as release branches, and when you're finished they behave the same way as finishing a release branch; the changes are merged
			back into both the production branch and the development branch, and a tag is created on the production branch for the hot fix release.</p>
