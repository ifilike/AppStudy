			<p></p>
			<h1>The Sidebar</h1>
			<p>The sidebar will look something like shown below, depending on whether it's a Git 
			or Mercurial repository:</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">
				<img src="../shrd/sidebar.png" alt="Sidebar" /><br/>
			</p>
			<h2>The File Status Section</h2>
			<p>
			Selecting the "Working Copy" item behaves the same way as if you click on the <a href="repo_filestatus.html">File Status</a> button
			on the View control on the toolbar.
			</p>
			<h2>The Branches section</h2>
			<p>
			This displays all your branches (local branches in Git). In Mercurial, if you close a 
			branch it will no longer appear on this list unless you re-open it. Selecting a branch
			will open the Log view and jump to that branch in the list. You can also right-click
			on the branch to get a number of context-sensitive options such as updating to/checking out the branch, merging it into your current branch, diffing that branch against your
			current branch, and more (on git there are also individual pull/push and tracking options). Double-clicking a branch will switch your current branch (after a confirmation dialog).
            </p>
            <p>Your current branch is indicated with bold text and a 'tick badge' 
            on the branch icon. In Git, the number of commits that your branch is ahead or behind
            the remote branch that it's tracking is displayed alongside the name, with an up arrow
            for ahead, and a down arrow for behind. In Mercurial, this is not necessary since these
            counts are not tracked per branch (just see the numbers on the Pull / Push toolbar icons).</p>
            <p>Note: if you create a branch with a name which includes a '/' character, SourceTree will display the branch as nested within a folder. This can help you group branches
            if you wish (this is also supported on tags and remote branches in Git).</p>
			
			<h2>The Tags section</h2>
			<p>This section is not expanded by default but if you expand it you'll see one entry
			for each tag. Selecting one will jump to that tag in the Log view, and there are
			options available in the context menu such as updating to the tag, deleting the tag or
			diffing your current working copy against it.</p>
			
			<h2>The Remotes section</h2>
			<p>This is where you find a list of remotes configured for this repository. You can pull from or push to a specific remote from the context menu on each item.</p>
			<p>On Git, you will also find a list of remote branches, and you can perform actions on 
			these via the right-click context menu or double-clicking to checkout.</p>
			
			<h2>The Stashes / Shelved section</h2>
			<p>Whenever you use the Stash (Git) or Shelve (Mercurial) function, a new item is created in this section, each one representing a set of changes that have been stored away for
			future use. You can click on these items to see a diff view of the changes they
			represent, and right-click an item to either apply it (unshelve it) back to your
			working copy, or to delete it if you don't want it anymore.</p>

			<h2>The Submodules / Subrepositories section</h2>
			<p>If your project has nested repositories within it, called submodules in Git or subrepositories in Mercurial, 
			they will appear here. See the <a href="repo_submodules.html">submodules and subrepositories</a> section for
			more details.</p>

            <h1>The Footer</h1>
            <p>The footer at the bottom of every repository window summarises the current state of the
            repository in one simple line. For example:</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">
				<img src="../shrd/footer.png" alt="Footer" /><br/>
			</p>
            <p>You'll see here the name of the current branch, followed by either a 'Clean' marker if
            there are no local changes, or a summary of the number of files outstanding in 
            each state if there are local changes. You will also see information here relating to 
            any outstanding merges and conflicts, if those apply.</p>
