			<h1>Using Subversion: General Principles</h1>
		</div>
		
		<p>SourceTree only supports local Mercurial and Git repositories; however it also allows you to work with 
		Subversion servers too via pre-configured bridging services (hgsubversion and git-svn). Both of
		these bridges let you 'clone' a Subversion server repository as a local Mercurial or Git repository, 
		allowing you to work locally with all the performance benefits and most of the flexibility of these distributed systems.</p>
		<p>Most importantly, this is not a one-way or one-off conversion - you can periodically pull new revisions from
		the Subversion server which will be converted into local Mercurial changesets or Git commits, 
		and you can push your local commits back to the Subversion server. Thus you can continue to
		work with legacy Subversion systems while gaining most of the benefits of newer technology locally.</p>
		
		<h2>Getting started</h2>
		<p>SourceTree cannot use an existing Subversion checkout, because that doesn't contain enough information
		to construct a full repository. Instead, you will need to clone from the Subversion server - and you 
		do this in exactly the same way as you clone a Mercural or Git repository from a remote location; just
		drag &amp; drop a Subversion server URL into your bookmarks window, or click 'Add Repository' and 
		fill in the Subversion URL in the Clone tab. SourceTree will automatically detect that it's a Subversion 
		repository, and give you the option of creating a Mercurial or Git repository locally from it. Which one you
		pick is largely down to your own preference, but please see the links below for specific considerations
		of using Subversion with each system.</p>
		
		<h2>Limitations of Subversion integration</h2>
		<p>While you can do most things with the Subversion integration, there are limits. Because
		Subversion is only a linear system and has only very basic support for merging, it is not
		possible to map the branching and merging of Mercurial and Git back to Subversion. This means
		that generally you should not try to perform merges in your repositories that are synchronising
		with Subversion, and SourceTree will warn you about that if you try. Instead, you should
		use the 'Graft' and 'Cherry Pick' functions to move changes between branches, or 
		perform merges in Subversion instead.</p>
        
        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        <h3>"This is not a valid source path / URL"</h3>
        <p>
            This problem can occur for two reasons. The first is SVN not being installed in which case there
            are two ways around this. The first is to install the command line tools through Xcode if you're using a Mac OS version
            before Mavericks. The second is that you'll be prompted to install the command line tools if you're
            using Mavericks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you've installed the command line tools the URL still may not work. First make sure you remove the
            URL and re-enter it if you've just installed the command line tools so SourceTree can re-verify the URL.
            If SourceTree still says "This is not a valid source path / URL" then it's most likely due to the
            server certificate not being accepted. To fix this go to your terminal and enter the following command:
            "svn info &lt;your_url&gt;" replacing "your_url" with the repository URL. Then make sure you either accept
            the certificate or accept it permanently. Once you've done this, re-enter the URL in the SourceTree clone
            dialog again and it should work as expected.'
        </p>
