				<h1>Using Mercurial with Subversion</h1>
			</div>
			
			<p>The bridge to Subversion in Mercurial is provided by <a href="http://bitbucket.org/durin42/hgsubversion/wiki/Home">hgsubversion</a>.</p>
			<h2>Supported Features</h2>
			
			<ul><li>Cloning a Subversion server repository to local Mercurial</li>
			<li>Progressive pull of new revisions from remote Subversion into local Mercurial changesets</li>
			<li>Progressive push of new local Mercurial changesets to remote Subversion server revisions</li>
			<li>Working within existing Subversion branches</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Unsupported Features</h2>
			<p>The following features are <b>not</b> supported by hgsubversion:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Creating new Subversion branches</li>
			<li>Creating new tags</li>
			<li>Merging branches</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Cloning Subversion To Mercurial</h2>
			<p>When you clone a Subversion URL, you have a choice - you can either clone a single branch of the repository (or the trunk), 
			represented in Subversion by unique URLs, or you can clone from the root of the repository, and if the repository is
			in the standard Subversion layout (branches, trunk and tags folders in the root), then the conversion will
			pick up the branches and tags and convert them appropriately.</p>
			
			<h2>Pushing and Pulling</h2>
			<p>Subversion only allows a linear history, compared to Mercurial which allows parallel development (resolved by rebasing or
			merging). Therefore when pulling and pushing changesets from/to Subversion, the history has to be 'flattened' in each branch.</p>
			<p>For this reason, only the active branch that your local repository is on is pushed or pulled, as opposed to the entire history
			as you are used to in Mercurial. And on doing this, if there has been any parallel development, hgsubversion will use 'Rebase' to 
			re-sequence your commits into a single linear path. If there are any conflicts during this process, you'll have to resolve them and re-commit
			before trying the operation again.</p>
			<p>Bear in mind that when you push changesets to Subversion, they will actually get 'rewritten' to reflect the actual Subversion
			commits once the push is completed. So commit dates will change, and the user names will change to what Subversion sees.</p>
			
			<h2>Working with Branches</h2>
			<p>hgsubversion cannot create new branches on Subversion. Therefore, you are limited to working with the
			branches that currently exist in the repository. If you've cloned from the root and your Subversion server
			has a standard layout (branches, tags and trunk) then you will have Mercurial branches corresponding to those
			and you are free to switch branches and commit to each separately (remember that only the active branch is pushed / pulled though).</p> 
			<p>If you cloned only a single branch (or the trunk), then you obviously will only be working with a single
			branch anyway in your local repository.</p>
			<p>You should not create any Mercurial branches in your local repository. SourceTree will warn you about this if you 
			try to do it, but will not ultimately stop you if you insist. The effect of Mercurial branches with Subversion servers
			can vary - if the branch has a linear history with an existing Subversion branch, the Mercurial branch will disappear when 
			you commit and only the Subversion branch will remain. If development has deviated, then you will not be able to 
			push the Mercurial branch to Subversion; you will have to transplant the changes to a Subversion branch. It gets messy, which 
			is why it's not recommended. If you need a new branch, create it in Subversion and pull it into your Mercurial repository instead.</p>
			
			<h2>Merging is not Supported</h2>
			<p>hgsubversion currently doesn't support converting Mercurial merges into Subversion 1.5 compatible merge info. If you
			do perform a merge, you will find that you cannot push to your Subversion repository anymore. SourceTree will warn you if
			you try to perform a merge on a repository that is using Subversion to avoid this, although if you force it, it will still 
			do it.</p>
			<p>hgsubversion also does not pick up merge info from merges that have occurred in Subversion already, so the log view will 
			not show any merges.</p>
			
			<h2>Migrating away from Subversion</h2>
			<p>One of the side benefits of using the Subversion interoperability is that effectively you've converted your
			repository to Mercurial just by cloning it. If you wanted to move away from Subversion later, you can use your local
			Mercurial repository as a base. Just remember that merge information is not present so you may wish to just
			convert a single branch at an opportune moment in time.</p>
			<p>If you no longer intend to use Subversion, delete the remote that refers to it in the Repository Settings view, 
			and also delete the svn metadata which lives inside the .hg/svn folder in your local repository. From that point on, 
			the repository will just be a regular Mercurial repository.</p>
