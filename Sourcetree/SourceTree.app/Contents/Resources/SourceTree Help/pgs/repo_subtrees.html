                As of version 1.8, SourceTree now supports the ability to add, pull, and push subtrees in
                your repositories (note: this is a Git-only feature). SourceTree will track your subtrees
                on a per-repo basis making future subtree commands easily accessible from the sidebar from
                previously created subtrees.
            </p>
            
            <h1>Adding/Linking Subtrees</h1>
            <p>
                It's important to note the difference between adding and linking subtrees. 'Linking' isn't a
                subtree concept but instead a SourceTree concept. Linking adds an entry into the SourceTree
                configuration file to associate a directory in your repository with a remote from which subtree
                commands can then be issued to pull and push commits. SourceTree can tell the difference based
                on whether the directory you specify exists or not. If the directory you specify doesn't exist then an 'add'
                will be performed, otherwise a link will happen (which doesn't make any subtree calls).
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To add or link a subtree you can either use the sidebar by context-clicking in any space and
                selecting 'Add/Link Subtree...' or alternatively using the 'Repository' menu.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The "Source Path / URL" is the path or URL of the repository for the subtree. "Branch / Commit"
                is either the branch name or the SHA of the commit you wish to pull in. SourceTree will list
                the branches of the repository you specify if you have access. The "Local Relative Path" is the
                path within your repository where the subtree project will be added (or the path to the existing
                subtree if it hadn't previously been linked in SourceTree).
            </p>
            
            <h1>Pulling Subtrees</h1>
            <p>
                When pulling a subtree you can simply context-click on the subtree from the sidebar and click
                on 'Pull Subtree...'. This will show a confirmation dialog with a 'Squash commits' checkbox
                that is by default enabled. The 'Squash commits' option will squash all of the remote commits into a single commit locally which is then merged in to your current branch.'
            </p>
            
            <h1>Pushing Subtrees</h1>
            <p>
                Much like pulling a subtree, again you can context-click on the subtree from the sidebar and click on 'Push Subtree...'.
            </p>
            
            <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
            <h2>Subtree Isn't Working</h2>
            <p>
                If subtree isn't working it could be because you're using system Git and haven't got a version installed that comes with subtree. To fix this you can <a href="http://engineeredweb.com/blog/how-to-install-git-subtree/">follow this guide</a>.
