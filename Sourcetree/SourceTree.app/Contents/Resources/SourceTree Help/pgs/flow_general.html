			<h1>What is Git Flow / Hg Flow?</h1>
			
			<p>In short, they're higher level tools to standardise how you use multiple branches effectively in Git or Mercurial.</p>
			
			<p>In early 2010, an article entitled <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">"A successful Git branching model"</a> 
			was published by Vincent Driessen, describing a standardised approach to using git branches in your development cycle. The idea was to 
			formalise the branching and merging actions that you perform when developing features, handling releases and managing hot fixes, so that every
			developer on a project took the same approach. In addition to promoting a consistent workflow, it also had the potential to reduce the
			training a new developer would need before they were developing with git in a way which leveraged the power of git (specifically its granular 
			branching and merging). However, the problem was you needed to remember the rules to this system.</p>
			<p>So, shortly after that, a series of scripts called <a href="https://github.com/nvie/gitflow">git-flow</a> provided a higher-level way to perform
			 those actions so that you wouldn't have to remember how to manually do them. Subsequently, a Mercurial extension called 
			 <a href="https://bitbucket.org/yujiewu/hgflow/wiki/Home">Hg Flow</a> implemented the same idea for Mercurial.</p>
			 <p>SourceTree now makes it even simpler by integrating this automation and presenting it to you in a friendly, easy to use way.</p>
			 
			 <h2>Summary of the concept</h2>
			 <p>The general idea is that you use the following branches in your repository:</p>
			 <ul>
			 	<li><b>Development branch</b> (usually called 'develop')<br/>
			 		This is your main development branch where all the changes destined for the next release are placed, either by committing
			 		directly for small changes, or by merging other branches (e.g. feature branches, discussed later)</li>
		 		<li><b>Production branch</b> (usually called 'master' in Git, 'default' in Mercurial)<br/>
		 			This branch represents the latest released / deployed codebase. Only updated by merging other branches into it.</li>
		 		<li><b>Feature branches</b> (usually prefixed with 'feature/')<br/>
		 			When you start work on anything non-trivial, you create a feature branch. Later on, you'll merge this back into the development branch
		 			to queue it for the next release.</li>
		 		<li><b>Release branches</b> (usually prefixed with 'release/')<br/>
		 			When you're about to package a new release, you create a release branch from the development branch. You can make more commits to it during
		 			your preparation for release, and when it's ready to be deployed you merge it back into both the development branch, and the master branch 
		 			(to indicate it's deployed).</li>
		 		<li><b>Hotfix branches</b> (usually prefixed with 'hotfix/') <br/>
		 			If you need to patch the latest release without picking up new features from the development branch, you can create a hotfix branch
		 			from the latest master branch (which is the latest deployed code). Once you've made your changes, the hotfix branch is then merged back
		 			into both the master branch (to update the released version) and the development branch (to make sure the fixes go into the next 
		 			release too)</li>
		 		</ul>
		 			
			 <h1>How to use Git Flow / Hg Flow in SourceTree</h1>
			 <p>There are two ways to perform 'flow actions' in SourceTree:</p>
 			 <p><b>From the Repository toolbar:</b></p>
			<p><img src="../shrd/flow_toolbar.png" alt="git-flow" /><br/>(this is labelled 'Hg Flow' in Mercurial)</p>
			<p>This toolbar button gives you a selection of actions based on the current state of the repository. So if you're currently on a feature
			branch, the default action it will offer you is to finish your current feature. You can also get to other actions from here, but most of the
			time the default one is the one you'll want to use. If your repository is currently not set up to use Git Flow / Hg Flow, then the toolbar
			button will bring up the <a href="flow_init.html">initialisation window</a>.</p>
			 <p><b>Alternatively, from the Repository menu bar:</b></p>
			 <p><img src="../shrd/flow_menu.png" alt="git-flow" /></p>
			<p>This menu lets you access all the possible actions that you can perform (the special case is the 'Next Action' option which does the same thing as
			the toolbar button). Each action is covered in more detail in the <a href="flow_actions.html">Flow Actions</a> section.
