				<h1>Using Git with Subversion</h1>
			</div>
			
			<p>The bridge to Subversion in Git is provided by the in-built git-svn</p>.
			
			<div>
				<h2>Supported Features</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Cloning a Subversion server repository to local Git</li>
					<li>Fetching new revisions from Subversion and displaying them as if they are a remote branch</li>
					<li>Progressive pull of new revisions from remote Subversion into local Git commits</li>
					<li>Progressive push of new local Git commits to remote Subversion server revisions</li>
					<li>Working within existing Subversion branches</li>
					<li>Creating new Subversion branches &amp; tags</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Unsupported Features</h2>
			<p>The following features are <b>not</b> supported by git-svn:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Merging Subversion branches</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Cloning Subversion To Git</h2>
			<p>When you clone a Subversion URL, you have a choice - you can either clone a single branch of the repository (or the trunk), 
			represented in Subversion by unique URLs, or you can clone from the root of the repository, and if the repository is
			in the standard Subversion layout (branches, trunk and tags folders in the root), then the conversion will
			pick up the branches and tags and convert them appropriately.</p>
			
			<h2>Pushing and Pulling</h2>
			<p>Subversion only allows a linear history, compared to Git which allows parallel development (resolved by rebasing or
			merging). Therefore when pulling and pushing changesets from/to Subversion, the history has to be 'flattened' in each branch, 
			which is done via rebase.</p>
			<p>Only the active branch is pushed or pulled to/from Subversion, and it needs to be a branch which was checked out from 
			a Subversion branch (which is like a remote branch). In practice, git-svn looks back in the history to the latest commit
			which has a Subversion revision ID on it (displayed in the commit message), and re-applies your commits against Subversion from there.</p>
			<p>In git-svn speak, SourceTree maps 'Push' to 'git svn dcommit' when you select the special "Subversion" remote. We do this
			to retain the usual workflow you're used to.</p>
			
			<h2>Merging is not Supported</h2>
			<p>The git merge information simply cannot be mapped back to Subversion accurately, so in practice you are limited
			to using Cherry Pick to move changes between branches (or using svn merge elsewhere). You can in theory
			merge <i>from</i> local Git branches to Subversion branches, you have to be extremely careful not to allow any
			Subversion commits to become part of a different branch, otherwise chaos will ensue. In practice it's best just to
			avoid it, and SourceTree warns you to this effect.</p>

			<p>git-svn also does not pick up merge information from merges that have occurred in Subversion already, so the log view will 
			not show any merges, only branches.</p>
			
			<h2>Migrating away from Subversion</h2>
			<p>One of the side benefits of using the Subversion interoperability is that effectively you've converted your
			repository to Git just by cloning it. If you wanted to move away from Subversion later, you can use your local
			Git repository as a base. Just remember that merge information is not present so you may wish to just
			convert a single branch at an opportune moment in time.</p>
			<p>If you no longer intend to use Subversion, delete the svn metadata which lives inside the .git/svn folder in 
			your local repository, and manually delete the 'svn-remote' entry in .git/config. 
			From that point on, the repository will act like a regular Git repository.</p>
